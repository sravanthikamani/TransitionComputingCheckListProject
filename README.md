Thanks for sharing your project structure! Based on this structure, I'll update the README.md file to reflect the organization of your project, which includes a React frontend and an Express backend. Below is an updated version of your README.md file, tailored to your project setup.


### Backend Setup (Express)
1. Navigate to the backend directory
bash
Copy code
cd backend
2. Install backend dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the backend server
bash
Copy code
node server.js
The backend server will be running on http://localhost:3001.

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
2. Install frontend dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the frontend development server
bash
Copy code

The React app will be running on http://localhost:3000.

### Checklist Rules
The following rules are evaluated:

Valuation Fee Paid: isValuationFeePaid should be true.
UK Resident: isUkResident should be true.
Risk Rating Medium: riskRating should be "Medium".
LTV Below 60%: (Loan Required / Purchase Price) * 100 should be less than 60.

### How to Add New Rules
To add or modify rules, follow these steps:

* Backend:

    Navigate to backend/checklistRules.js.
    Add a new rule by following the structure of the existing ones.
